## Features
Windows 11 has a gazillion toggles and settings options.

- You can skip the assistant and let the app module on the main page handle the analysis entirely. It will check and fix a tons of unnecessary components and creating a debloated Windows 11.

- Next to this the app installer **Packages** is integrated, which allows you to install some of the most important apps with a click and in bulk.
